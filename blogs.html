    <h1><span style="color: var(--main-color);">21/90</span> Rule</h1>

    <p>This is one of the famous rule and many people had implemented it.
        The rule states that it takes 21 days to a person to change a 
        habit or to break a habit. And 90 days to make it as permanent lifestyle.
        isn't it interesting ? You can even apply in any of your work which you want to make it as a habit. Ex. Suppose you want to 
        make a habit of daily coding. You can try to follow this rule then after that you can see your habits will change what you 
        previously not used to be.

        <h2>Origin of this rule</h2>

        The 21/90 formula was born in 1960, when a cosmetic surgeon called Dr Maxwell Maltz wrote a self-help book called Psycho Cybernetics, 
        A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life. 
        In his book he suggested that it takes a mere 21 days of practice for an old mental image of us to dissolve and a new one to “gel”

        <h2>The 21/90 rule is difficult , but possible</h2>

        <h3>1. Identify habits and make a plan</h3>

        This is the easiest step. Just list down the habits you want to develop and in the list make one as most priority and cancel out
        remaining ones.

        <h3>2. Stay positive</h3> 
        During the phase of this rule , one may feel to quit or it feels that it's not possible to continue due to random thoughts in mind.
        But remember one thing why you started this rule and what was the purpose you needed from this. Just be continue the work you do
        irrespective of the results.

        <h3>3. Small Steps</h3>
        One should remember in life that a baby don't start walking from the birth itself. Baby will initially crawl and then he tries to stand
        and he falls. But the baby don't stop they will take small steps or try to walk by support. In this way one should be keep there
        focus more on small steps rather than completing all at once.

        <h3>4. Consistency</h3>
        Remember that you can't do the work or the habit daily then it can't be developed. Consistency is key to most of the suceed in life.

        <h3>5. Activity you love</h3>
        Other than daily habit you want to develop , Do one activity which you love daily for few minutes - It can be writing, read books, 
        songs etc. It will help you to keep motivated and stay ahead in the rule.
