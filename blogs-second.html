    <h2>Git</h2>

    <p>
        Git is a software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaborative
        developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed,
        non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).

        <h3>History</h3>

        Git development began in April 2005, after many developers of the Linux kernel gave up access to BitKeeper, 
        a proprietary source-control management (SCM) system that they had been using to maintain the project since 2002. 
        The copyright holder of BitKeeper, Larry McVoy, had withdrawn free use of the product after claiming that Andrew Tridgell had 
        created SourcePuller by reverse engineering the BitKeeper protocols.

        <h3>Data structures</h3>

        The object database contains five types of objects:
        <br>
A <span style="font-weight: bold;">blob</span> (binary large object) is the content of a file. 
Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata (A blob's name internally is a hash of its content.). 
In git each blob is a version of a file, it holds the file's data.<br>
A <span style="font-weight: bold;">tree</span> object is the equivalent of a directory. 
It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, 
or directory's contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a Merkle tree, meaning that only
 a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to precisely pinpoint to the exact state of
  whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)<br>
A <span style="font-weight: bold;">object</span> links tree objects together into history. 
It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a timestamp, a log message, and the names of zero 
or more parent commit objects.<br>
A <span style="font-weight: bold;">tag</span> object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added
 meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a digital signature of a commit object corresponding
  to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.<br>
A <span style="font-weight: bold;">packfile</span> object is a zlib version compressed of various other objects for compactness and 
ease of transport over network protocols.
